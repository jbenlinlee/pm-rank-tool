### Organizing your rank list
Just drag and drop until things are in the order you want. When you commit, PM Rank Tool
will clear the selected rank field and then set the rank field for your selected issues.

To remove an OPP from your rank list, click on the OPP you want to remove and hold the
mouse button down until the OPP disappears.

To clear your rank list, simply commit an empty rank list.
